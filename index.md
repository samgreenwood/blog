Hey, I'm SamÂ Greenwood!

{{site.footer_description}}

I spend most of my day job writing web applications in PHP, working with other teams on business process improvements, and overall software architecture.

My development skills are mostly geared towards backend development, APIs, database design and scaleable application architecture.

I spend my nights and weekends hanging out with my awesome family, playing games, drinking craft beer, hacking on code or something in between.
