My blog was on a broken server for a while, so everytime I went to write something, I ended up trying to fix things when I should have just been writing.

I had some sprare time this weekend, so decided to ditch the Wordpress and switch over to something that 'Just Works' - So i've gone with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub pages.

Hopefully this means more blogging, I have a lot of draft posts in the works, 2019 should be a better year for blogging.
